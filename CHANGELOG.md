  - Uses OpenAI-compatible API via ModelScope
  - Environment variable changed from `ZHIPUAI_API_KEY` to `MODELSCOPE_KEY`

- **Pose Detection Model**: Default changed from FULL to LITE
  - LITE model provides better performance on low-end servers
  - Configurable via `MEDIAPIPE_MODEL` environment variable (`lite` or `full`)

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed race condition in camera initialization where video element might not be mounted in time
  - Replaced fixed 100ms delay with `requestAnimationFrame` polling (max 2s timeout)

- Fixed port configuration inconsistency
  - Local development now correctly defaults to port 8000
  - Docker single-container deployment uses 7860 (set via Dockerfile ENV)

- Fixed Docker Compose configuration
  - Removed port conflict (both nginx and frontend were binding to host port 7860)
  - Added `PORT=8000` to backend environment for correct port binding
  - Frontend now uses `expose` instead of `ports` (nginx handles external access)

- Fixed frontend Dockerfile for static export mode
  - Previous Dockerfile expected `output: "standalone"` but next.config.ts uses `output: "export"`
  - Now uses `serve` package to serve static files from `out/` directory

## [0.2.2] - 2026-01-25

### Performance Optimization - Non-blocking LLM Feedback

#### Fixed

- **Critical: Eliminated 1-2 second stuttering** caused by blocking LLM API calls
  - Root cause: `FeedbackNode` awaited LLM API response synchronously, blocking frame processing
  - Solution: LLM feedback generation now runs in background using `asyncio.create_task()`

#### Changed

- **Feedback Node** (`app/services/coach/workflow/nodes/feedback.py`)
  - Background task pattern: feedback generated asynchronously, results delivered on next frame
  - Added `_pending_generation` task tracking to prevent duplicate generations
  - No blocking of frame processing pipeline

- **Pose Detection** (`app/services/coach/pose/detector.py`)
  - Switched back to VIDEO mode from LIVE_STREAM for better responsiveness
  - Default model changed to LITE for performance (configurable via `MEDIAPIPE_MODEL` env var)
  - VIDEO mode provides synchronous results without the 1-frame delay of LIVE_STREAM

- **Frontend** (`frontend/app/coach/page.tsx`)
  - Increased frame rate to 20 FPS
  - Added keypoint smoothing (EMA) for smoother skeleton rendering
  - Using `requestAnimationFrame` for optimal frame timing
  - Increased capture resolution to 480x360 for better detection
  - `PHASE_NAMES` moved to module level constant

#### Technical Decisions

| Decision                    | Rationale                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Background LLM generation   | LLM API calls take 1-2 seconds; running in background prevents frame blocking |
| VIDEO mode over LIVE_STREAM | LIVE_STREAM has 1-frame delay; VIDEO mode is synchronous and more responsive  |
| LITE model by default       | Better performance on low-end servers; FULL available via env var             |
| Keypoint smoothing (EMA)    | Reduces jitter in skeleton rendering, factor of 0.25 for responsiveness       |

#### Performance Impact

- **Eliminated periodic 1-2 second freezes** during exercise sessions
- Smooth 20+ FPS skeleton rendering
- LLM feedback still generated every 6 seconds but no longer blocks UI

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-24

### Performance Optimization - Async Processing & Data Transfer

#### Changed

- **Critical: Eliminated Full Image Return** (`app/api/routes/websocket.py`)
  - Server now returns only keypoint coordinates (~1KB) instead of full annotated images (~15KB)
  - **90%+ reduction in WebSocket data transfer**
  - Removed server-side skeleton drawing and image encoding for each frame

- **Frontend Skeleton Rendering** (`frontend/app/rehab/page.tsx`)
  - Added client-side skeleton drawing using Canvas API
  - `drawSkeleton()` function renders pose with color-coded feedback
  - Increased frame rate from 8 to 10 FPS (feasible due to reduced latency)
  - Added `POSE_CONNECTIONS` constant for MediaPipe 33-landmark skeleton

- **Pose Detection** (`app/services/coach/pose/detector.py`)
  - Added `detect_async()` method using thread pool executor
  - Added `draw_landmarks_async()` method for non-blocking drawing
  - Added `detection_scale` parameter (default 0.5x) for faster detection
  - Frame downscaling before MediaPipe processing reduces computation time
  - Shared `ThreadPoolExecutor` with 2 workers for CPU-bound operations

- **Detection Node** (`app/services/coach/workflow/nodes/detect.py`)
  - Updated to use async pose detection
  - Added `get_annotated_frame_async()` method
  - Configurable `detection_scale` parameter passed through factory function

- **WebSocket Handler** (`app/api/routes/websocket.py`)
  - Added async `decode_frame_async()` for base64 decoding
  - Dedicated `ThreadPoolExecutor` with 2 workers for image I/O
  - Returns `keypoints` and `skeleton_color` instead of `annotated_frame`

#### Technical Decisions

| Decision                       | Rationale                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client-side skeleton rendering | Eliminates ~15KB/frame return transfer, removes encoding latency            |
| Thread pool for pose detection | MediaPipe is CPU-bound, thread pool prevents blocking async event loop      |
| 0.5x detection scale default   | MediaPipe landmarks are normalized, half resolution sufficient for accuracy |
| Return keypoints as JSON       | ~1KB vs ~15KB per frame, 90%+ bandwidth reduction                           |

#### Performance Impact

- **Network transfer reduced by 90%+** (keypoints ~1KB vs full image ~15KB)
- Event loop no longer blocked by CPU-intensive operations
- Server no longer encodes images for each frame
- Smoother real-time feedback with lower latency
